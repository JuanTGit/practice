"How does technology impact your everyday life?"

"Technology is a big part of how I learn, work, and stay connected. For the past four years, Ive been building 
full-stack apps, which has deepened my understanding of how technology solves real-world problems. 
Its become a big part of how I think and approach challenges."



"How did you hear about HCSS?"

"I heard about HCSS through a friend who encouraged me to apply. He had great things to say about the companys 
culture and work environment. After learning more about HCSSs mission and values, I felt they really aligned with the 
kind of impact I want to make—helping people through technology and being part of a team that genuinely supports its customers."


"What is the difference between customer service and customer support?"

“To me, customer service is about the overall experience a customer has—its proactive, focused 
on building relationships and making sure the customer feels valued. Customer support, on the other hand, 
is more reactive—it involves helping customers solve specific technical or product-related issues. 
Both are important, and I believe combining strong service with effective support creates the best customer experience.”
