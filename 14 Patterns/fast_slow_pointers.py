HOW TO IDENTIFY WHEN TO USE FAST AND SLOW POINTERS:
    The problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array.
    
    When you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list.

When should I use it over the Two Pointer method mentioned above?
    There are some cases where you shouldnt use the Two Pointer approach such as in a singly linked list where you cant move in a backwards direction. 
    An example of when to use the Fast and Slow pattern is when youre trying to determine if a linked list is a palindrome.

Problems featuring the fast and slow pointers pattern:

    Linked List Cycle (easy)
    Palindrome Linked List (medium)
    Cycle in a Circular Array (hard)
