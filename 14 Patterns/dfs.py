How to identify the Tree DFS pattern:
    If youre asked to traverse a tree with in-order, preorder, or postorder DFS.
    If the problem requires searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf.
Problems featuring Tree DFS pattern:
    Sum of Path Numbers (medium)
    All Paths for a Sum (medium)

Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. 
The algorithm starts at the root node and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
