# 438. Find All Anagrams in a String
# Medium
# Given two strings s and p, return an array of all the start indices of p's anagrams in s. You may return the answer in any order.

# An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
# Output: [0,6]
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
# The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

# Example 2:

# Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
# Output: [0,1,2]
# Explanation:
# The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
# The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
