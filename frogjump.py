# Third was tricky... Two frogs are sitting on a rock, get into an argument
# and want to go as far away from each other as possible. You're given a list 
# of blocks of various heights, the frogs can only jump to another block of greater 
# or equal height to their current block. Find the greatest distance they can achieve 
# between them, they can start on any block that lets them get the greatest distance 
# between them.
