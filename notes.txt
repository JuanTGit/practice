LeetCode Approach:

Systematic Approach

1.) Simplify Problem

    - Given inputs -> Expected outputs
        * "The inputs are ____. We do ____ to the inputs. We get ____ as the output."
    
    - Ask questions and catch edge cases.

2.) Pattern Recognition

    - Straight forward solution
        * Identify time and space and find optimizations

3.) Implementation Plan


4.) Code


5.) Debug

    - Syntax Error

    - Implementation Error
        * Not many test failed (check edge cases)
        * Else mistake in Implementation (add print statements)
